# Project: Identify Customer Segments

In this project I've applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data is private and has been provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
